I heard, that your settled down. 　　
已闻君，心有所属
That you, found a girl and your married now.
觅得佳人，婚嫁在即
I heard that your dreams came true. 　　
已闻君，美梦成真
Guess she gave you things, I didn't give to you. 　　
思度卿予君者，不似我

Old friend, why are you so shy?
旧相识，何必衣襟掩面
It ain't like you to hold back or hide from the lie.
这不似你 遮遮掩掩 欲说还羞

I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited.
不请自来 非我所愿
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it. 　　
避之不得 抵之不能
I'd hoped you'd see my face & that you'd be reminded, 　
曾望他日相逢 朱颜铭君心
That for me, it isn't over.
此情于我常追忆
Nevermind, I'll find someone like you. 　　
勿烦恼 终有佳偶得似君
I wish nothing but the best, for you too. 　　
万事皆空 祝福寄君 
Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said:
勿忘我 但愿如君所言
"Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead" 　　
 情深醉人亦伤人
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead, yeah. 　　
 情深醉人亦伤人

You'd know, how the time flies.
时光荏苒避
Only yesterday, was the time of our lives. 　　
昨日春侣今何在
We were born and raised in a summery haze. 　　
夏岚日浓情亦浓
Bound by the surprise of our glory days. 　　
君骑竹马妾弄梅
I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited.
不请自来 非我所愿
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it. 　　
避之不得 抵之不能
I'd hoped you'd see my face & that you'd be reminded, 　
曾望他日相逢 朱颜铭君心
That for me, it isn't over.
此情于我常追忆

勿烦恼 终有佳偶得似君
I wish nothing but the best, for you too. 　　
万事皆空 祝福寄君 
Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said:
勿忘我 但愿如君所言
Nothing compares, no worries or cares. 　　
无事可比 无可挂碍
Regret's and mistakes they're memories made. 　　
往昔斑驳
Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste? 　　
谁解其中味

Nevermind, I'll find someone like you. 　　
勿烦恼 终有佳偶得似君
I wish nothing but the best, for you too. 　　
万事皆空 祝福寄君 
Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said:
